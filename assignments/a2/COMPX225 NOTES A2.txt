I'm plucking feathers from my shoulders,
the wings, I used to have.

I used to soar the city...
Now? I wanna try decaf.

And as time flys by,
you'll lose feathers too,

but it's not the feathers that do the flying
- that's me and you.




I don't fly anymore, 
but I'm still not grounded,

waiting to be found can often,
leave you dumb-founded,

She values a strangers smile,
so, she'd stop to pick it up,


Her gilded locks weighed heavy in the wind,

Her shouldered smile drew his cheeky grin,

But that's all gone now, 
Dust in the wind,

And on the darkest days,
He'd slouch, sloshed and ponder why some things never work,
Like an onyx-pillared heaven with sparrows on its church,
Or like a crystal-laced underworld, radiating light beneath our feet,I don't fly anymore, but I'm still not grounded, 


On the earth is where he stays, but grounded he is not,




They'd never have worked anyway,
